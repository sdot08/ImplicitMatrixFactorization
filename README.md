# ImplicitMatrixFactorization

Raw data from https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile.
The data is composed of more than 48 million triplets (user, song, listening frequency) recovered from the listening user histories. Data were provided from several applications, where each user can listen to the music he wanted. Data from 1.2 million users listening to 380,000 songs.

This project focused on the collaborative filtering approach based on Matrix Factorization.
